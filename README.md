This repository includes several small Python scripts related to automata theory and regular languages. The main topics covered are:

- DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata)
- NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automata)
- Conversions between NFA and DFA
- Lambda-NFA to DFA conversion
- NFA to Regex transformation
- Pumping Lemma for proving non-regular languages
